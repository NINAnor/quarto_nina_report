# quarto_nina_report
A quarto template for NINA-reports. Basic functionality works, but there might be some quirks to fix.

So far, only the PDF version is supported. This requires a working installatin of XelaTeX. A future HTML version might be developed.

To use: run this in the terminal window on a machine with a Quarto installation. This will create a subfolder in your location.
