# quarto_nina_report
A quarto template for NINA-reports. Basic functionality works, but there might be some quirks to fix.

So far, only the PDF version is supported. This requires a working installatin of XelaTeX. A future HTML version might be developed.

For usage, run in terminal window on a machine with a Quarto installation:
quarto use template NINAnor/quarto_nina_report
