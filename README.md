# quarto_nina_report
A quarto template for NINA-reports. Basic functionality works, but there might be some quirks to fix.

So far, only the PDF version is supported. This requires a working installatin of XelaTeX. A future HTML version might be developed.

To use, run this in the terminal window on a machine with a Quarto installation (For NINA, typically https://rstudio.nina.no). This will create a subfolder in the folder you are standing in (in the terminal).
